//This script requires a game logic entity and any desired trigger to work correctly
//No script files required


// This script will disable simulation on all desired units for use when triggering events 
// and to save on performance. If you are not triggering a specific event, but rather you
// want AI or objects to activate when players are nearby, instead use the vanilla 'dynamic
// simulation' option available in group and performance settings.

// #1 Create a game logic entity and synchronize all desired objects; input this code in the 'init' segment:

grp = synchronizedObjects this;
{_x enableSimulationGlobal false} forEach grp;

// #2 Set up a custom trigger with the desired conditions; input the following code in the 'on activation' segment:

{_x enableSimulationGlobal true} forEach grp;

// Edit the code as you wish to create the desired effect
